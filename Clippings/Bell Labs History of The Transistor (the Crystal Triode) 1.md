**“Nature abhors the vacuum tube.”** - J.R. Pierce, Bell Labs engineer who coined the term ’transistor'

Bell Labs is the birthplace of the Transistor, inventing the device that led to a communications revolution.

John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley discovered the transistor effect and developed the first device in December 1947, while the three were members of the technical staff at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ. **\[To view the patent, see [US Patent #02569347](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/pdf/02569347.pdf) which was issued on September 25, 1951\]** They were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956.

Developed as a replacement for bulky and inefficient vacuum tubes and mechanical relays, the transistor later revolutionized the entire electronics world. The transistor sparked a new era of modern technical accomplishments from manned space flight and computers to portable radios and stereos. Today, billions of transistors are manufactured weekly."

**[Here are a few pages](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/pdf/brattain_lab_notebook.pdf)** from Walter Brattain’s lab notebooks on December 24th 1947, the day the world’s first transistor was successfully tested. The Bell Labs Press Release of the transistor dated July I, 1948 can be viewed by clicking **[HERE](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/pdf/bell-labs%20transistor%20announcement.pdf)**.

A ballot was sent around Bell Labs to come up with a name for the transistor. **[HERE](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/pdf/transistorname.pdf)** is a (poor) copy of that ballot.

" **A picture of the first transistor ever assembled**, invented in Bell Labs in 1947. It was called a point contact transistor because amplification or transistor action occurred when two pointed metal contacts were pressed onto the surface of the semiconductor material. The contacts, which are supported by a wedge shaped piece of insulating material, are placed extremely close together so that they are separated by only a few thousandths of an inch. The contacts are made of gold and the semiconductor is germanium. The semiconductor rests on a metal base.

The shape of the transistor has changed dramatically since it was invented at Bell Labs in 1947 as a replacement for the vacuum tube. Clockwise from the top: 1941 vacuum tube used for telephone communications; the point-contact transistor as it was introduced June 30,1948 to the world, six months after its invention; 1955 transistor which replaced vacuum tubes in network communications equipment; 1957 diffused base high frequency broadband amplifier; 1967 microchip, used to produce the tones in a touch-tone telephone set, contained two transistors; and (center) a Lucent Technologies digital signal processor chip, which can contain as many as 5 million transistors, used in modems and cellular communications.

Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments (TI) directed the development of the silicon transistor. Texas Instruments' silicon device with its three long leads became famous making TI the sole supplier of silicon transistors for several years in the 1950’s. Morris Tanenbaum at Bell Labs actually made the first silicon transistor, but he felt “it didn’t look attractive” from a manufacturing point of view.

**My Collection of Vintage Transistors**

I’ve collected dozens of transistors since I was a teenager. Other kids my age were collecting record albums but transistors take up a lot less room than record albums!

The first photo is my most recent acquisition of a rare transistor which is the Western Electric point-contact part number 2N23. I actually have three of these - two are still [sealed in their foil envelopes inside a cardboard container](https://memorial.bellsystem.com/images/2n23_0.jpg).
