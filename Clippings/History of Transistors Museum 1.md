| ## 1950s IBM GERMANIUM COMPUTER TRANSISTORS  ## Early IBM Transistors: Shown at top are a series of early IBM transistors that were qualified for use in the Model 608 calculator, introduced in 1955. The chart above lists the range of IBM transistors types available at this time. IBM used transistors manufactured by other companies for the 608 as well as transistors manufactured by IBM. For example, the leftmost type 51 above is date code 1957 week 40 and is identifiable as an IBM device based on the unique oval case shape and “two-hole” bottom header construction. The three next type 51 transistors, with date codes in 1956, are likely Sylvania devices and are shown next to two 1955 Sylvania GT792 transistors with performance similar to the type 51. The device on the far right is another mid-1950s Sylvania transistor, type GT692, manufactured to meet IBM specifications including the “double-height” case style. The Museum will soon open a new section dedicated to the history and technology of transistors used in the first solid state computers. Check back often.  \| **![](https://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index_image009.jpg)** \| **75 YEARS OF THE TRANSISTOR**  **The first transistor in history came to life on December 16,1947 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.

Most notable were germanium power transistors designed for car radio audio output – as shown above, the quantity of this type of transistor manufactured by Delco reached 25 million in 1963. Many thanks to Ray Brack for donating this unique device. Ray has been active in the designing and repairing electronic equipment for many years, and he has been saving the device shown above for a long time, hoping to find an appropriate museum.</span></b></p></td><td width="432" colspan="2" rowspan="2"><p align="center"></p><figure><img width="158" height="115" src="https://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index_image026.jpg"><figcaption>gt 66 photo transistor</figcaption></figure><p></p><p align="center"><b><span>General Transistor Company GT66, 2N318</span></b></p><p align="center"><b><span>Germanium Photo Transistor</span></b></p><p align="center"><b><span>Vintage: </span></b><b><span>1956</span></b></p><p align="center"><b><span>Donated by</span></b> <b><span>Dennis Uhlich</span></b></p><p><b><span>General Transistor Corporation was a premier manufacturer of germanium alloy junction transistors in the latter part of the 1950s. The company was founded by engineers and managers who had originally been associated with another early transistor manufacturer, Radio Receptor. One of the most unique and historic germanium transistor devices was the photo transistor, and General Transistor was a primary supplier, with the product sold initially as the GT66 and later as the 2N318. This device is very similar to the Radio Receptor RR66 photo transistor. The above device (note date code of 1956, week 52) has been donated to the Transistor Museum by Dennis Uhlich, who was convinced that this was a unique device, although there wasn’t much research information available on the internet. Dennis’ contribution included the device, along with a comprehensive data sheet.

Many thanks to Dave Larson for the generous donation to the museum of these transistors (and a number of other related devices). Dave also provided these comments: “Thanks for the info. I am glad they are in a safe place where they will be archived for future generations to enjoy! As far as the reference to the donor. Please put them in memory of my father Meyer H. Axler, who worked on early transistor development projects at Bell Labs and Baird Atomic. I am looking forward to seeing them on the virtual museum. Thanks for all you are doing on behalf of early research scientists like my father.”</span></b></p></td></tr><tr height="0"><td width="288"></td><td width="144"></td><td width="144"></td><td width="288"></td></tr></tbody></table>
