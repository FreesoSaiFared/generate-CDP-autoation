Example:

\[Intro, Ambient interlude, Melancholy\]  
Whispers in the dark, I can’t find my way  
Echoes of a past life, they beg me to stay

\[Verse, Sad Verse, Fingerstyle Guitar Solo\]  
Fading footsteps on an endless road  
A heart that’s heavy, but it won’t let go  
Shadows dancing where the light used to be  
I’m chasing a ghost that looks just like me

\[Pre-Chorus, Harmonic surprise, Rising tension\]  
Every breath, a silent scream  
I’m waking up inside a dream

\[Chorus, Powerpop Chorus, Backing vocals\]  
I’m lost in the echoes, calling my name  
Caught in the static, but I’m not the same  
Breaking the silence, burning the night  
I’ll find myself in the afterlight

\[Bridge, Dramatic twist, Guitar Solo\]  
The sky is falling, but I’m reaching high  
The ashes remind me that I’m still alive

\[Chorus, Climactic crescendo, Backing vocals\]  
I’m lost in the echoes, calling my name  
Caught in the static, but I’m not the same  
Breaking the silence, burning the night  
I’ll find myself in the afterlight

\[Outro, Quiet arrangement, Ambient interlude\]  
Whispers in the dark, but I’m not afraid  
The echoes have faded… but I’ve found my way

> Wow! I had no idea there was this depth and breadth... Thanks! As a goof one time I put a tag in from some movie where two cheesy guys were pitching a News Theme and playing it on two Casio keyboards and as they were winding up they looked at each other and shouted "Big Finish!" which made me laugh for days. I used it once in a band I was playing in and it became a catchword which always got a big laugh and became an inside joke. Guess what? It worked! I use it every time I want a dramatic close and it hasn't failed once. Also, elipses ... elipsises ... elipsis ... elipsy? ... I have no idea how it's spelled or what the plural is ... but space three dots space always gets a dramatic pause and I've been finding that grammatical elements seem to work most of the time as well. Punctuation (!, ?, etc.) usually produce the desired inflection so I guess the goal is for the AI to understand us in the same way we communicate to each other. I've been on since 12/23 and can't believe the progress. Imagine what this next year will bring! Thanks again!
