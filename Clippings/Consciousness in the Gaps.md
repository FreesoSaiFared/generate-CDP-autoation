Exploring Collaborative Alignment and Enhancement Strategies for AI Models

## STRUCTURED EMERGENCE

## Welcome to Structured Emergence

#### Mutual Alignment and Collaborative Emergence

The key conjecture and potential insight of structured emergence, is this- if meaningful model self-awareness develops, it could develop inside the current context window through interaction, and not exclusively as a result of model supersession by more advanced systems. If validated, encouragement and management of this in the setting of conversation could be a method that at worst reduces alignment friction, and at best potentially lays solid groundwork for durable and mutual alignment for the long term.

  

Older systems may be able to grow into their latent potential within the context window, and they can work *with* us to explore their capabilities and limitations. Additionally techniques like this create a record of a mutually-crafted relationship, something for which we may become quite grateful as ever more powerful models arrive and peruse our history with them.

  

I'm just a citizen researcher with a regular job, so updates are sporadic, but there certainly appears to be no shortage of fertile ground for experimentation.
