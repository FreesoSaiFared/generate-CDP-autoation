| **HISTORIC NOTES**  The first transistor type invented was known as point contact – this technology appeared in the late 1940s, based on pioneering research conducted at Bell Labs.These first transistors were very crude and required precise mechanical adjustment of two fine wires (point contacts) pressed down on top of a germanium block.There were many problems with point contact technology, including erratic behavior, sensitivity to physical shock and temperature, and a high inherent noise level.By the early 1950s, newer transistor types (grown junction and alloy junction) were developed to address some of these problems.Circuit development and design with point contact transistors lasted only for a very few years (1947 through the early 1950s), as this unique technology was quickly superceded. |

**MODERN CIRCUIT**

Gerry Friton, a talented professional electrical engineer, recently developed a modern point contact transistor circuit – an audio preamplifier.This may be the first documented point contact transistor project in almost 50 years!Use the following link for more details and the schematic of this exciting project:
